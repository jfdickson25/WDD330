        <h2>Week 4 Notes:</h2>
        <div class='notes'>
            <p>The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all
                the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. Even though there is only one form
                in our example, a collection will still be returned, so we have to use index notation to return the
                first (and only) form object, like so:</p>
            <p>Be careful referencing elements in this way, however. If the form had the same name as any properties or
                methods of the document.
                forms object, such as 'submit', for example, that property or method would be referenced instead of the
                form element. This is unlikely
                to happen, as the document.form object doesn't have many properties or methods, but it is something to
                be aware of. To avoid this, square
                bracket notation can be used (this is also required if the formâ€™s name attribute contains any invalid
                characters, such as spaces or dashes):</p>
            <p>We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form
                object.
                So, for example, the input field has a name attribute of searchInput and can be accessed using this
                code:

                const input = form['searchInput']</p>

            <p>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the
                HTML.

                A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional
                scripting:

                button type='reset' Reset /button</p>
            <p><h3>DOM Manipulation Example</h3>
                A good example of how libraries can help save time is in DOM manipulation. The DOM API provides all the
                tools required to manipulate the DOM, but some can be verbose and take several lines of code to attain
                even the most basic of tasks. <br><br>

                For example, if we wanted to add a class to a paragraph element referenced by the variable para , then
                append another paragraph on the end, we could do it using the following: <br><br>

                <small>para.classList.add('important');<br><br>
                const newPara = document.createElement('p');<br><br>
                newPara.textContent = 'Another Paragraph';<br><br>
                para.appendChild(newPara);</small><br><br>
                Yet by using the jQuery library, we can achieve the same result using a single line of code: <br><br>

                <small>$(para).addClass('important').append('Another Paragraph');</small></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Week 4 code examples:</h2>
        <div class='notes'>
            <code>
                const form = document.forms['search']; <br>
                form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false); <br>
                function search() { <br>
                alert(' Form Submitted'); <br>
                } <br>
            </code>

           <small><p>We can actually stop the form from being submitted to that URL altogether by using the preventDefault()
                method that we saw in the last chapter. Add the following line to the search function:
            </p></small>

            <code>
                function search(event) { <br>
                alert('Form Submitted'); <br>
                event.preventDefault(); <br>
                } <br>
            </code>

            <small><p>Underscore & Lodash</p></small>
            <code>// flatten an array <br>
                _.flatten([1, [2, [3, [4]], 5]]); <br>
                 [1, 2, [3, [4]], 5] <br>
                // return the last element in an array <br>
                _.last([1, 2, 3]); <br>
                 3 <br>
                // randomly shuffle an array <br>
                _.shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4]); <br>
                // => [4, 1, 3, 2]</code>
