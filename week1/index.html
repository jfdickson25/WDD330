            <h3>Syllabus</h3>

            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>"By taking advantage of the opportunities this course presents, you will develop fundamental knowledge
                and skills in computing and technology and improve your professional possibilities by:</p>

            <p>
                becoming more efficient at applying your innate curiosity and creativity,
                becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment,
                becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others,
                using a divide and conquer approach to design solutions for programming problems,
                finding and trouble shooting bugs you and others will have in the code you write, and
                developing and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programs that use medium complexity web
                technologies."
            </p>

            <h3>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h3>
            <p>"Did you catch that? Since a key can only be associated with one
                thing at a time, you have to convert the array of customers into one
                thing. That one thing is a JSON string. Do this, and now you’ve
                fooled localStorage into associating a key with multiple things.
                Kind of like getting a young child to have more than one best
                friend like adults do."</p>

            <h3>Creating a portfolio</h3>
            <p>"As you read, take notes and complete exercises record your work in this portfolio,
                making sure to keep the index up to date. If you do then turning in the link to your portfolio will
                be the best way to turn in your work each week, and at the mid and final checkpoints."</p>

            <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
                
                    <p>Mobile first allows for much easier transition to desktop</p>
                    <p>Designing mobile first is much more cost effective.</p>
                    <p>Users can reach buttons most easily at the bottom of the screen. Try to keep buttons at the bottom of the screen rather than the top.</p>
                    <p>Use svg rather than png or jpg. This allows the connection with the server not to be slowed down.</p>
